A program that can create neural networks and train them using only vanilla Python. Multilayer perceptrons with forward and backward propagation are written from scratch.

XOR and Two-Bit Adder training sets are shown in hw1.py. You can control the number of inputs, outputs, and hidden layers. Activation functions are set to sigmoids.
